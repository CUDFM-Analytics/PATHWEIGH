This R project contains all of the scripts, functions, and report layout for processing the PATHWEIGH compass data deliveries.

The code in this project is maintained as a separate project that is version controlled by GitHub.

For each compass data delivery the scripts/subscripts for data processing are modified and updated as the project needs evolve.

It was decided to opt for one central project containing the data processing scripts, rather than maintain separate sets of scripts for each data delivery.
