# Define WPVs by Chief Complaints %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
# Relevant chief complaints include search terms for "weight", "obesity," or 
# "obese". "Weight Loss Consult" or "Weight loss" in tandem with "Weight 
# Management."

# The key words that could be used in a filter statement are:
# 1. WEIGHT MANAGMENT, will include those with "WEIGHT LOSS"
# 2. WEIGHT PROBLEM
# 3. WEIGHT CHECK
# 4. WEIGHT GAIN, must exclude "INADEQUATE WEIGHT GAIN"
# 5. WEIGHT LOSS CONSULT
# 6. WEIGHT CHANGE
# 7. OBESITY

  ## 1. Chief Complaints ----
  # Create a list of all possible unique AND relevant Encounter Chief Complaints
  # to use for matching encounter chief complaints
  
  # Works on the chief complaints column, drops any NAs, sets only the unique
  # combinations of complaints, separate rows using the ";" as a separator, then
  # trims the white spaces. Gets the unique columns again and then matches for 
  # anything with WEIGHT or OBES. Recodes WEIGHT LOSS CONSULT to WEIGHT CONSULT 
  # to be able to filter out WEIGHT LOSS, then filters out WEIGHT LOSS or 
  # INADEQUATE, and then recodes WEIGHT CONSULT back to WEIGHT LOSS CONSULT. 
  # n.b. two unique() statements are not needed but having both greatly improves 
  # processing speed.
