# Capture comorbidities at index and last visits as function

# The comorbidities.R script loads a function that was designed to capture 
# the comorbidities for each patient that with the restriction that the comor-
# bidity appeared at least 2 times in the medical record within a span of 2 
# years prior to the baseline index date. 

# Since interest was developed in looking at comorbidities at the last visit
# this script relies on the get_comorbidities() function to capture the 
# comorbidities at the index visit in control, intervention and at the last 
# visit in control or intervention. The last visit is the last non-index visit
# in each phase control or intervention.
