# WPVs for Supplement 2:
# Supplement 2 in Leigh's draft submission to NEJM for the pathweigh study EMR
# data primary aims.

# The following code is used to tabulate the number of weight prioritized visits
# in a given clinic, the number of visits where the pathweigh tools were 
# utilized, and the total number of visits in each intervention period

# Inputs:
# Relies on loading the processed visits_post_id data frame that is generated
# after running 02_process_rdata_image.R script.

# Output:
# Generates a .csv file that consists of the required outcome counts grouped
# by clinic.
