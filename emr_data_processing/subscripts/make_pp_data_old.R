# Make per protocol data
# Outputs:
# pp_mod_data is the data set for modeling
# pp_data is the dataset for making tables, it's a subset of visits_post_id

# Subset to those with visits in both intervention and control
# Identify and flag those with PW tools visits

# Inputs:
# input is ee_ene data set to be able to also compare ee vs ene in modeling

# Dependencies:
# requires visits_post_id data set as a dependency because it contains all of
# the labs, procedures, meds, and vitals captured at the index visit in each 
# phase

# Identify and flag patients that have PW tools --------------------------------
# Use the index visits in addition to the mod data visits to  find who has PW
# tools.

# Extract the index visits from visits post id to utilize the index visits to
# determine whether or not there was any use of pathweigh tools.
# It is not sufficient to filter visits_post_id simply by the Arb_PersonIds in 
# ee because it is possible that the same patient has two or more visits in the
# control phase, but not in the intervention phase. So patient ids in ee must be
# filtered in conjunction with each intervention phase.
